        This guide will teach you everything you need to know about building a Discord bot with Node.js. We'll be using Autocode to host your code for free, handle auth to Discord and automatically set up webhook handlers to make it easy.
        Introduction
        If you haven't used Discord yet, chances are this is your first time using the internet. Welcome, friend! It is a magical place. All joking aside, Discord is a messaging platform with fantastic voice and video streaming capabilities originally built to service gaming communities. It offers a lot of extensibility via bots, custom moderation tools and more which we'll show you how to work with here.

        In this tutorial we'll cover how to set up a fully customizable Discord bot that you can have running in your server in around 10 minutes. We'll be using Autocode, which will provide you with free hosting, automatically handle authentication to Discord and set up webhooks for you. This will allow you to focus on the fun part: building an awesome bot for your server!

        What you'll get
        By completing this tutorial you'll get a Discord bot install on your server that can be customized any way you want. To start, it will:

        Respond to a basic /ping slash command.
        Send a message when you say hey, hi, hello, or sup.
        A guild welcome embed message.
        Prerequisites
        The only three things that you will need to complete this tutorial are:

        A free Discord account. We'll walk through the bot generation later.
        A free Autocode account. Our basic app example will also cover this.
        A relentless curiosity. If you like building, hacking and learning new things â€” this one's for you!
        Quickstart
        If you just want to quickly get your bot up and running, we have a pre-built basic Discord example app for you to get started with. This app will set up a barebones bot project with handlers for bot_mention and message.create events, as well as a handler for a slash command called member-count. The rest of this tutorial will walk through building a similar bot from scratch.
